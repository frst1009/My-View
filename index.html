                <h4>Marvel: End Game</h4>
                <p>Needed a minute to sit down and realise what 
                i watched because this movie was bomb. After i watched End game i took it as 
                a responsibility of mine to share and attract a lot more people into Marvel 
                MCU Universe. In my opnion it is the best movie of all times. From the first minute it
                promised to be the best. From the script to the acting all was made perfectly. The main characters are Avengers. Havent heard 
                of them yet? Better check out them first before diving in to this crazy adventure.</p>
                <p>
                    Here is the chronological order of The Avengers movies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marvels: The Avenger</li>
                        <li>Avengers: Age of Ultron</li>
                        <li>Avengers: Infinity War</li>
                        <li>Avengers: End Game</li>
                    </ul>
                    But before we dive in to more detailes *without spoilers* here
                    are some fact that will make you love this movie a lot more if you already watched it,
                    and if not, be ready to become a fan.

                    1)“I love you 3000” Was Robert Downey Jr’s Idea
                    The film had many catchy dialogues but this line stayed
                    with us. But did you know that the original line was “I love you tons” not “I love you 3000”?
                    It was actually Robert Downey Jr’s idea to change to the latter by remembering what one of his children said to him.
                    Interestingly, 3000 meant the whole runtime of all MCU movies until then.<br />
                    2) Big Spenders
                    Incredible box office returns were necessary to make Avengers: Endgame a profit. Endgame has been listed as one of the most 
                    expensive films ever made. On top of an estimated budget of $356 million, more than $200 million was spent on the marketing campaign 
                    for this film. Frankly, we’re surprised it needed that big of a marketing campaign after all the hype that was already built up by the 
                    end of Avengers: Infinity War.
                </blockquote>
                <p> i think this will help you actually to construct and build the understanding of movie and get tyou interested in it)))</p>

                <p>
                 Not only plot twists but the whole idea of this movie is so interesting and facinating actually. All that hard times and 
                    things Avengers had gone through was tough experince and actually the human kind ecperienced in some sort same situation
                    that was in the movie itself but I'll leave no spoilers as i promised. Either way if you are still here i can't believe 
                    you didn't run to watch yet. Go ahead and enjoy it)))
